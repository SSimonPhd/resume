## SUMMARY <br/>
PhD in Information Science × Philosophy × Musicology specializing in AI ethical annotation, multimodal curation, and symbolic systems. Leveraged research in info theory and music semiotics for AI data labeling, including audio-text alignment and red-teaming. Applied symbolic cognition to DeFi protocol analysis, informing AI ethics in decentralized systems. DeFi native (Aave power user since 2021, managing over-collateralized position), UT Austin bootcamp 2023 grad, lifelong classical guitarist. Remote-only; available for flexible expert work in AI training/annotation (humanities/multimodal), ethics evaluation, or crypto tech writing/support.

## SKILLS <br/>
AI/Data: Ethical Labeling, Multimodal Curation, Red-Teaming, Audio-Text Alignment, Cultural Datasets, Symbolic Systems Analysis <br/> 
Crypto: Protocol Analysis, Portfolio Management

## EXPERIENCE <br/>
AI Safety Red Teamer | Mercor | Jan 2026 - Present <br/> 
• Conduct model output comparisons and task flagging for RLHF annotations in AI safety project, identifying biases and vulnerabilities using SuperAnnotate platform.
• Apply ethical red-teaming expertise from production DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound) to evaluate AI responses for threat intelligence and safety risks in asynchronous, remote environment.
• Contribute to quality assurance pipeline, providing actionable feedback on model behavior to support support advanced AI development objectives.
• Leverage PhD in ethics/symbolic systems, multimodal curation (audio-text alignment from music technology), and graduate-level prompt evaluation experience for nuanced bias detection in high-stakes AI training tasks.


DeFi Specialist | FinTech | 2020 – Present <br/>
• Managed over-collateralized Aave positions with technical analysis, applying info theory to evaluate protocols ethically for decentralized systems. <br/>
• Developed trade strategies through market research, focusing on structural critiques transferable to AI ethics/ideology annotation. <br/>
• Utilized apps (Aave, Uniswap, MetaMask, Ledger) for portfolio optimization, informing symbolic data curation in AI contexts. <br/>

Music Technologist | eLearning Services | 2011 – 2021 <br/>
• Delivered music education via in-person/online (Zoom), curating semiotics/aesthetics content—applied to AI audio-text alignment/emotion labeling. <br/>
• Used software/hardware (Pro Tools, Sibelius, Guitar Pro) for performance/research, informing multimodal data curation in symbolic systems. <br/>
• Provided consultation on musical structures, breaking down interpretations akin to AI prompt evaluation/red-teaming. <br/>

Professor | School of Information | University of South Florida | Tampa, FL | 2006 – 2011 <br/>
• Taught graduate courses in info architecture/research methods, evaluating prompts like AI red-teaming for 100+ students. <br/>
• Curated datasets/resources for music info services, transferable to multimodal AI curation/cultural labeling. <br/>
• Integrated philosophy/musicology in teaching, fostering symbolic reasoning for ethics domains in frontier models. <br/>
