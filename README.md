## SUMMARY <br/>
PhD in Information Science (ethics, symbolic systems, philosophy, musicology) currently contributing as AI Safety Red Teamer (contract) at Mercor, conducting model output comparisons and RLHF flagging to identify biases and vulnerabilities. Specialize in ethical AI annotation, multimodal curation, and red-teaming. Leveraged research in information theory and music semiotics for data labeling, audio-text alignment, and prompt evaluation. Applied symbolic cognition to DeFi protocol analysis (Aave/Compound since 2020), informing AI ethics in decentralized systems. DeFi native (Aave power user, managing over-collateralized position), UT Austin coding bootcamp 2023 graduate, lifelong classical guitarist. Remote-only; available for flexible expert work in AI safety/red-teaming, ethics evaluation, multimodal annotation, or crypto/DeFi specialist support. Rate $40–200/hr (depending on complexity).

## SKILLS <br/>
AI & Data: AI Safety Red Teaming & Bias Detection, Ethical Labeling & RLHF Annotation, Multimodal Curation & Audio-Text Alignment, Prompt Evaluation & Model Output Comparison, Symbolic Systems Analysis & Cultural Datasets
Crypto/DeFi: Protocol Red-Teaming & Incentive Analysis (Aave, Compound), Portfolio Management & Risk Assessment

## EXPERIENCE <br/>
AI Safety Red Teamer | Mercor | Jan 2026 - Present <br/> 
• Conduct model output comparisons and task flagging for RLHF annotations in AI safety project, identifying biases and vulnerabilities using SuperAnnotate platform. <br/>
• Apply ethical red-teaming expertise from production DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound) to evaluate AI responses for threat intelligence and safety risks in asynchronous, remote environment. <br/>
• Leverage PhD in ethics/symbolic systems, multimodal curation (audio-text alignment from music technology), and graduate-level prompt evaluation to provide actionable feedback on model behavior for advanced AI development. <br/>

DeFi Specialist | Independent Investor | 2020 – Present <br/>
• Managed over-collateralized Aave positions with technical analysis, applying info theory to evaluate protocols ethically for decentralized systems. <br/>
• Developed trade strategies through market research, focusing on structural critiques transferable to AI ethics/ideology annotation. <br/>
• Utilized apps (Aave, Uniswap, MetaMask, Ledger) for portfolio optimization, informing symbolic data curation in AI contexts. <br/>

Music Technologist | Simon Music Services | 2011 – 2021 <br/>
• Delivered music education via in-person/online (Zoom), curating semiotics/aesthetics content—applied to AI audio-text alignment/emotion labeling. <br/>
• Used software/hardware (Pro Tools, Sibelius, Guitar Pro) for performance/research, informing multimodal data curation in symbolic systems. <br/>
• Provided consultation on musical structures, breaking down interpretations akin to AI prompt evaluation/red-teaming. <br/>

Professor | School of Information | University of South Florida | Tampa, FL | 2006 – 2011 <br/>
• Taught graduate courses in info architecture/research methods, evaluating prompts like AI red-teaming for 100+ students. <br/>
• Curated datasets/resources for music info services, transferable to multimodal AI curation/cultural labeling. <br/>
• Integrated philosophy/musicology in teaching, fostering symbolic reasoning for ethics domains in frontier models. <br/>
